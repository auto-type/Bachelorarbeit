The study indicates that implementing SDR technology boosts student motivation and learning, with 73.13% believing it enhances engineering education and 96% showing increased motivation [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5L8PU48?page=1&annotation=JIXPXR9N)

**Kommentar:** Quelle SDR hilft bei Motivation und "learning"

Ellingson (2016) extended the academic implications, highlighting contribution of SDR to university education in systems engineering (Ellingson, 2016) [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5L8PU48?page=1&annotation=QJYBQGWM)

**Kommentar:** Leider kann ich das Buch nicht ohne weiteres lesen oder kaufen deshalt mb das zitat genau so klauen

The document follows the following structure: First, it provides a contextualization of the term SDR and traces its evolution over recent decades. Subsequently, the results of the literature review are presented, covering topics such as the components of SDR architecture and the associated technologies involved in its development. The document then explores the primary applications of SDR, referencing academic sources that have embarked on laboratory implementations or the adoption of SDR technology, thereby facilitating advancements in academic and research  projects. Subsequently, a proposal for laboratory guides developed through the implementation of low-cost SDR technology as a teaching approach is introduced. These laboratory guides are compared with conventional teaching approaches. Then, based on the obtained learning results and perception surveys conducted, conclusions are draw [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5L8PU48?page=2&annotation=LSX2RQB4)

**Kommentar:** Sehr gute Basis Struktur zum Orientieren und natürlich auch als so "blueprint" für den Text in der Bachelorarbeit

1992, Joseph Mitola published one of the first works related to software radio, and later, he coined the term “cognitive radio” to describe intelligent radios (Mitola, 2003), [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5L8PU48?page=2&annotation=29AE2Q84)

**Kommentar:** Zweite Quelle hierfür falls noch nicht erwähnt

As mentioned (Galvis et al., 2007), by the year 2004, the majority of SDR applications were primarily military-oriented due to the high implementation costs. In fact, 76.5% of all applications were military-focused, 7.1% were for commercial wireless infrastructure, and 16.4% pertained to other application domains [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5L8PU48?page=3&annotation=4XX8MPLW)

**Kommentar:** Quelle: Am Anfang der 2000er Jahre waren SDRs vor allem für militärische Zwecke interessant aufgrund der hohen Implementationskosten, heutzutage jedoch eignen sie sich auch zur Bildung, da die Anschaffungskosten so sehr gefallen sind

Additionally, the trend of interconnecting various devices under the Internet of Things (IoT) concept requires SDR technology to enable the connectivity of multiprotocol devices. Ideally, IoT should support multiple standards and allow for device management and updates, leveraging the advantage of compatibility with the “Over the Air Programming” concept, which refers to wireless updates for optimal IoT implementation (Hessar et al., 2020).

**Kommentar:** Oha interessanter Punkt zu IoT und SDR bzw. *why it matters*
