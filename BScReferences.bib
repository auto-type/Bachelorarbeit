  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has not yet reached a distinctive definition. A generic understanding of IoT is that it offers numerous services in many domains, utilizing conventional internet infrastructure by enabling different communication patterns such as human-to-object, object-to-objects, and object-to-object. Integrating IoT objects into the standard Internet, however, has unlocked several security challenges, as most internet technologies and connectivity protocols have been specifically designed for unconstrained objects. Moreover, IoT objects have their own limitations in terms of computation power, memory and bandwidth. IoT vision, therefore, has suffered from unprecedented attacks targeting not only individuals but also enterprises, some examples of these attacks are loss of privacy, organized crime, mental suffering, and the probability of jeopardizing human lives. Hence, providing a comprehensive classification of IoT attacks and their available countermeasures is an indispensable requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel four-layered IoT reference model based on building blocks strategy, in which we develop a comprehensive IoT attack model composed of four key phases. First, we have proposed IoT asset-based attack surface, which consists of four main components: 1) physical objects, 2) protocols covering whole IoT stack, 3) data, and 4) software. Second, we describe a set of IoT security goals. Third, we identify IoT attack taxonomy for each asset. Finally, we show the relationship between each attack and its violated security goals, and identify a set of countermeasures to protect each asset as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that attempts to provide a comprehensive IoT attacks model based on a building-blocked reference model.},

  abstract = {Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force to efficiently manage the functions of the network layer when providing Internet connectivity for wireless sensor networks. RPL has been designed for constrained devices and networks. Owing to their constrained nature, RPL-based networks can be exposed to a wide variety of security attacks. One of the most serious attacks in RPL is a black hole attack, where a malicious node silently drops all the packets that it is supposed to forward. This paper proposes a mitigation technique against black hole attack with low packet loss and high reliability. The proposed technique consists of a local decision and a global verification process. First, each node observes the communication behavior of its neighboring nodes by overhearing packets transmitted by its neighbors and attempts to identify suspicious nodes based on their behavior. In the second process, if a node identifies a suspicious node, then it verifies whether the suspicious node is a black hole. We demonstrate that the proposed approach increases packet delivery rate significantly and detects black hole attack effectively. Copyright \copyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This study investigates the characteristics of deauthentication signals generated by a Flipper Zero device as captured by a HackRF One Softwaredefined radio (SDR). By analyzing signal parameters such as power levels, frequency bands, and modulation techniques, distinct features differentiating deauthentication attacks from legitimate network traffic are identified. Results indicate that deauthentication attacks introduce notable power level spikes, increasing from approximately -80 dBm to -30 dBm at a distance of one meter. The deauthentication signal typically occupies a 6 MHz bandwidth centered around 2.422 GHz. Signal strength decreases to -35 dBm and -40 dBm at distances of five and ten meters, respectively. These findings complement existing packet-based detection methods by providing additional insights into deauthentication attack characteristics, enabling the development of more robust detection systems through the integration of waveform analysis and advanced signal processing techniques.},

Computationally efficient means of detecting spoofing is then addressed, namely codeless spoofing detection by phase-difference measurement of the signals received from a two-antenna array. We conclude by using a simple and effective method to suppress spoofing to restore positioning and time-transfer capabilities, and extend the demonstration to jamming cancellation.

This development naturally poses more and more complex security challenges. One of the key attributes of IoT is that it makes heavy use of wireless communications to allow for mobility and ease of installation. It is important to note this is not just Wi-Fi, but all manner of other Radio Frequency (RF) protocols: Bluetooth, BTLE, ZigBee, Z-Wave, etc. The increasing ubiquity of such devices and networks promises to make life easier (smart locks, smart bulb, smart home appliances...), however manufacturers often overlook the security in the implementation of these RF communication systems. This paper uses the Software Defined Radio (SDR) to study vulnerabilities in IoT devices using an unknown RF protocol as the analyzing frequency, demodulation and decoding RF signals used in the wireless IoT devices, jamming the target and replaying radio packets. A number of schemes have been proposed to mitigate such attacks. This study also provides an empirical environment sufficient to prove the exploit of that vulnerabilities.},

Compared to an expensive spectrum analyzer, the HackRF One provides an affordable solution for education and simple research projects. We compare the measurement of HackRF One with a spectrum analyzer and found that spurious signals were seen with HackRF One due to the mixing and down-conversion process. However, such imperfections may offer opportunities for hands-on learning and deeper understanding of the radio signal processing. Due to its half-duplex operation, HackRF One cannot be used as a GSM BTS. However, it can still function as a GSM signal sniffer.

Firstly, it increases the transmission data rate of ZigBee. The Dual Radio ZigBee design furnishes low latency and highly accurate telehealth service at home. Secondly, the zero-configuration design of the DR-ZHG offers the most user friendly telehealth service to elderly people and long-terms patients. Analysis reveals that, for streaming data devices, the network depth should be confined to three (3) in a ZigBee tree network. As for polling data devices, it is analyzed that nine (9) sensors can be supported in a single hop communication. To align with the maximum hop count of three (3) for streaming devices, seven (7) polling devices can be accommodated. In summary, the developed DR-ZHG supports seven (7) polling service sensors and one (1) streaming service senor. Such a gateway meets the general latency standard of 2s for telemedicine services as stipulated by U.S. NIST.},

It is also important as a convenient base technology for the future context-sensitive, adaptive and learning radio units referred to as cognitive radios. SDR also poses many challenges, however, some of them causing SDR to evolve slower than otherwise anticipated. Transceiver development challenges include size, weight and power issues such as the required computing capacity, but also SW architectural challenges such as waveform application portability. SDR has demanding implications for regulators, security organizations and business developers.},

  abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to revolutionize the way we interact with our living spaces, the concept of smart homes has become increasingly prevalent. However, along with the convenience and connectivity offered by IoT-enabled devices in smart homes comes a range of security challenges. This paper explores the landscape of smart-home security. In contrast to similar surveys, this study also examines the particularities of popular categories of smart devices, like home assistants, TVs, AR/VR, locks, sensors, etc. It examines various security threats and vulnerabilities inherent in smart-home ecosystems, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and device tampering. Additionally, the paper discusses existing security mechanisms and protocols designed to mitigate these risks, such as encryption, authentication, and intrusion-detection systems. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of user awareness and education in maintaining the security of smart-home environments. Finally, the paper proposes future research directions and recommendations for enhancing smart-home security with IoT, including the development of robust security best practices and standards, improved device authentication methods, and more effective intrusion-detection techniques. By addressing these challenges, the potential of IoT-enabled smart homes to enhance convenience and efficiency while ensuring privacy, security, and cyber-resilience can be realized.},

  abstract = {Software Defined Radio systems are predicted to be radio access networks of next generation in all kind of wireless communications systems. Their use is not limited to radio front end that is first chosen for system operation. They can be upgraded by time as system needs changes or evolves which gives them radio front end flexibility never seen before in radio systems. Smart home environments such as eWALL system and other uses numerous of wireless technologies to control lot of appliances in them or to monitor specific health state of the people living there etc. Therefore, lot of wireless technologies have been developed solely for that purpose, leaders among them are ZigBee and Z-Wave technologies which are today standard for wireless home automation systems that are energy efficient and secure. Software Defined Radio is certainly very useful for future mobile communication systems. In this work Software Defined Radio system will be evaluated with a purpose of introducing local radio networks that are used in smart home environments based of Software Defined Radios. Benefits and shortcomings of using Software Defined Radio in this systems will be shown and evaluated.},

  abstract = {Two Software Defined Radio (SDR) approaches for assisted wildlife tracking with a multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are described. The approaches are Pseudo Doppler (PD) and Yagi Rotation (YR), where each method corresponds to a common Radio Direction-Finding (RDF) technique. Pseudo Doppler utilizes the Doppler Effect by digitally sampling four (or more) monopole antennas in a sequential and circular order, simulating the rotation of a single monopole antenna. This approach can be complex with SDRs and suffers from reduced signal reception from the omnidirectional monopoles. The Yagi Rotation technique utilizes the directional Yagi antenna, rotating 360{$^\circ$} about the antenna's center of mass. As the antenna is rotated, the SDR System calculates the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the incoming radio signal. The Yagi Rotation was implemented and field tested; numeric results shown in this paper indicate that system accuracy is limited to the azimuth beamwidth of the Yagi antenna. Due to complexity and reduced signal reception from omnidirectional monopoles, the Pseudo Doppler approach was not implemented; however, a system design is presented. Finally, the SDR methodology and UAV control implications of each approach are discussed in this paper.},

The ZigBee protocol has particularly become prevalent for home automation and controlling devices such as door locks and garage door openers. Preventing attacks and reducing vulnerabilities is imperative in cases where there can be high financial losses due to poor security implementations. For systems where low power and cost are desirable, but security is a priority, the application developer must be extremely cautious in the design of their network. This paper surveys security issues and vulnerabilities in the ZigBee specification and current key management schemes proposed for these networks.},

  abstract = {SDR has increasingly become an invaluable research, development, and educational tool within the telecommunications sector with respect to rapidly prototyping new algorithms and paradigms in actual radio hardware and evaluating them in real-world over-the-air conditions. Due to advances in microprocessor technology, radio frequency hardware, and software, SDR has matured into a reliable tool that is now part of almost every communication engineer's toolbox, and it has changed the way the telecommunication sector produces innovative solutions to technical challenges. In this article, we explore four case studies that highlight SDR as a reliable tool in industry, academia, and government. Specifically, we study four examples that illustrate: advances in low-cost, reliable, and versatile SDR platforms, open source and universal SDR software development environments, powerful technical computing environments employing SDR hardware for real-world experimentation, and educational paradigms for synthesizing digital communications and digital processing concepts using SDR technology. By understanding the impact of these case studies, we intend to provide some insight on how the SDR revolution has changed the way the world designs and implements telecommunication systems.},
