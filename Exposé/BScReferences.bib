  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has not yet reached a distinctive definition. A generic understanding of IoT is that it offers numerous services in many domains, utilizing conventional internet infrastructure by enabling different communication patterns such as human-to-object, object-to-objects, and object-to-object. Integrating IoT objects into the standard Internet, however, has unlocked several security challenges, as most internet technologies and connectivity protocols have been specifically designed for unconstrained objects. Moreover, IoT objects have their own limitations in terms of computation power, memory and bandwidth. IoT vision, therefore, has suffered from unprecedented attacks targeting not only individuals but also enterprises, some examples of these attacks are loss of privacy, organized crime, mental suffering, and the probability of jeopardizing human lives. Hence, providing a comprehensive classification of IoT attacks and their available countermeasures is an indispensable requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel four-layered IoT reference model based on building blocks strategy, in which we develop a comprehensive IoT attack model composed of four key phases. First, we have proposed IoT asset-based attack surface, which consists of four main components: 1) physical objects, 2) protocols covering whole IoT stack, 3) data, and 4) software. Second, we describe a set of IoT security goals. Third, we identify IoT attack taxonomy for each asset. Finally, we show the relationship between each attack and its violated security goals, and identify a set of countermeasures to protect each asset as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that attempts to provide a comprehensive IoT attacks model based on a building-blocked reference model.},

  abstract = {Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force to efficiently manage the functions of the network layer when providing Internet connectivity for wireless sensor networks. RPL has been designed for constrained devices and networks. Owing to their constrained nature, RPL-based networks can be exposed to a wide variety of security attacks. One of the most serious attacks in RPL is a black hole attack, where a malicious node silently drops all the packets that it is supposed to forward. This paper proposes a mitigation technique against black hole attack with low packet loss and high reliability. The proposed technique consists of a local decision and a global verification process. First, each node observes the communication behavior of its neighboring nodes by overhearing packets transmitted by its neighbors and attempts to identify suspicious nodes based on their behavior. In the second process, if a node identifies a suspicious node, then it verifies whether the suspicious node is a black hole. We demonstrate that the proposed approach increases packet delivery rate significantly and detects black hole attack effectively. Copyright \copyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Deauthentication attacks remain a significant threat to wireless network security. This study investigates the characteristics of deauthentication signals generated by a Flipper Zero device as captured by a HackRF One Softwaredefined radio (SDR). By analyzing signal parameters such as power levels, frequency bands, and modulation techniques, distinct features differentiating deauthentication attacks from legitimate network traffic are identified. Results indicate that deauthentication attacks introduce notable power level spikes, increasing from approximately -80 dBm to -30 dBm at a distance of one meter. The deauthentication signal typically occupies a 6 MHz bandwidth centered around 2.422 GHz. Signal strength decreases to -35 dBm and -40 dBm at distances of five and ten meters, respectively. These findings complement existing packet-based detection methods by providing additional insights into deauthentication attack characteristics, enabling the development of more robust detection systems through the integration of waveform analysis and advanced signal processing techniques.},

Computationally efficient means of detecting spoofing is then addressed, namely codeless spoofing detection by phase-difference measurement of the signals received from a two-antenna array. We conclude by using a simple and effective method to suppress spoofing to restore positioning and time-transfer capabilities, and extend the demonstration to jamming cancellation. Experiment results demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods with an emphasis on computational efficiency for real-time execution on embedded single-board computers.},

One such example of SDR is the HackRF One, which covers the frequency of 30 MHz -- 6 GHz and can be programmed as an FM receiver/transmitter, a GSM receiver, or a simple spectrum analyzer. Compared to an expensive spectrum analyzer, the HackRF One provides an affordable solution for education and simple research projects. We compare the measurement of HackRF One with a spectrum analyzer and found that spurious signals were seen with HackRF One due to the mixing and down-conversion process. However, such imperfections may offer opportunities for hands-on learning and deeper understanding of the radio signal processing. Due to its half-duplex operation, HackRF One cannot be used as a GSM BTS. However, it can still function as a GSM signal sniffer. The flexibility and programmability of SDR provide an ideal platform for projectbased learning in telecommunication engineering.},

However, along with the convenience and connectivity offered by IoT-enabled devices in smart homes comes a range of security challenges. This paper explores the landscape of smart-home security. In contrast to similar surveys, this study also examines the particularities of popular categories of smart devices, like home assistants, TVs, AR/VR, locks, sensors, etc. It examines various security threats and vulnerabilities inherent in smart-home ecosystems, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and device tampering. Additionally, the paper discusses existing security mechanisms and protocols designed to mitigate these risks, such as encryption, authentication, and intrusion-detection systems. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of user awareness and education in maintaining the security of smart-home environments. Finally, the paper proposes future research directions and recommendations for enhancing smart-home security with IoT, including the development of robust security best practices and standards, improved device authentication methods, and more effective intrusion-detection techniques. By addressing these challenges, the potential of IoT-enabled smart homes to enhance convenience and efficiency while ensuring privacy, security, and cyber-resilience can be realized.},
